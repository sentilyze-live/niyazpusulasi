    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

    <p>Niyaz Pusulasi ("App") respects the privacy of its users. This policy explains what data is collected, how it is used, and how it is protected.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Location Data</h3>
    <p>The App uses your device's location to calculate prayer times and Qibla direction. Location data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is processed only on your device</li>
        <li>Is not sent to our servers</li>
        <li>Is not shared with third parties</li>
        <li>Is not used for tracking purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you prefer not to grant location access, you can use the App by manually selecting your city.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Purchase Data</h3>
    <p>When you purchase a premium subscription, the payment is handled entirely by the Apple App Store. RevenueCat is used to manage your subscription status via an anonymous user identifier. We do not have access to your credit card or payment information.</p>

    <h3>1.3 User Data (On-Device)</h3>
    <p>Habit logs, prayer tracking, and daily reflection data are stored only on your device (CoreData). This data is not sent to any server.</p>

    <h2>2. Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Name, email address, or phone number</li>
        <li>Browsing history</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (for advertising)</li>
        <li>Usage analytics</li>
        <li>Health or fitness data</li>
        <li>Contact list or photos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h3>3.1 RevenueCat</h3>
    <p>RevenueCat is used for subscription management. It operates using anonymous user identifiers and purchase receipts. It does not have access to your personal information. RevenueCat privacy policy: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">revenuecat.com/privacy</a></p>

    <h3>3.2 AlAdhan API</h3>
    <p>Anonymous requests may be sent to the AlAdhan API to cross-validate prayer times. These requests contain only coordinates and calculation method — no personal information.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>All your data is stored encrypted on your device using Apple's iOS security infrastructure (Data Protection, Keychain). Since we do not store data on servers, there is no risk of server-side data breach.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is suitable for ages 4 and above. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>6. Advertising</h2>
    <p>The App contains no advertisements and does not share data with advertising networks.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy may be updated. Significant changes will be communicated within the App.</p>
